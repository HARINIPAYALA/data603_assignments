# DEFINE BIG DATA:  
term big data is coined as extensively large data and complex data sets, in other words collection of huge amount of data both the structured and the unstructured data from different resources is called big data. And hence this data has to undergo changes using different tool like data mining and data warehousing etc and some other important business tools. Usually this data is being used in large business organisation and other sector and however its not about the size or the execessive data but also it is about the getting best outcome from it.

## TYPES OF BIG DATA:-
1.	STRUCTURED DATA:- The term structured data is defined as which is in the good form like format, organised, easy to understand and analysed. This organised data should be easily accesbile as it has gone many forms to become a organised and analysed data.   Structured data is nothing but a data model and hence it is in a order form and it can be access by anyone or else even by the computer also.
EXAMPLE OF STRUCTURED DATA ARE :- SQL databases, spreadsheets in the excel, etc
2.	UNSTRUCTURED DATA:- The term unstructured data is defined as which the data model cannot be understood which does not have any format, unorganised and this also has unstructured format which cannot be understand by the computer itself. And this kind of data cannot be even stored in the form of tables and rows because its not in the form of organised data.
EXAMPLES OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA ARE:- Email are the first most thing which are unstructured with of lot of messages, word files which are not in the good format and cannot be understand etc.
EXAMPLES OF THE BIG DATA:-
1.	BANK AND FINANCIAL SERVICES:- As banks many number of customers and undergo many transactions using many mobile applications and even the card transactions as well . To avoid this kind of chaos in the banking sector they are many organised methodology to avoid which are like fraud detection where many card holders can do fraud transaction like duplicate transaction on behalf of the person so that time using the big data analytics they can detect the fraud transaction as well.
2.	SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM- These days social media platform plays a major role in the big data analytics to analyse the large number of data from the applications like to increase the business quality customer review is also used, and the main goal is to target marketing promotions and targeting the customer potential growth like using the recommendation system according to the customer most reviewed data.
3.	BUSINESS APPLICATIONS:- Due to increasing in the amount of application growth online marketing such as shein, amazon, uber eats which can be delivered to any location everything is done through online marketin and in this lots of customer data is collected and according to that data recommendation system is provided to give them the best shopping ideas according to their wishlist.

6 Vâ€™S OF BIG DATA:-
1.	VOLUME-  The volume of data is nothing but the large amounts of data which comprises of more size and with a certain value of data. The volume data is so large data and about this volume of data only it is known big data. And this data mentions that whether it should be considered as big data or not depending on the volume of the data.
2.	VELOCITY:-  The term velocity itself refers to the speed accumulation of the data like whether how fast the data flows into the applications such as facebook, macines and networks. This velocity of the big data plays a major role in the big data analysis because the if the speed is more only the outcome can also be received fast and accurately. For example innumerable searches are done on the google, and the data should also be received to the customer as fast as possible and correctly as well.
3.	VARIETY:- Variety is nothing which just depends on the nature of the structured, unstructured and semi structured data. This data usually comes from the both the interior and the exterior of the business organisation.

1.	STRUCTURED DATA:- The structured data is nothing but the organised data which has an order to follow.
2.	UNSTRUCTURED DATA:- The unstructured data is nothing but the data which cannot be understand and which is not in the correct order.
3.	SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA:- The semi-structured data is nothing but the semi organised data which is partially organised but not completely like example of log files.
  4.VERACITY:- The term veracity is data which is large inconsistency where the data can become difficult when it is more and the quality of the data also changes and its become uncontrollable and data in bulk can always create confusion to how to sort it.
5.VALUE:-  How much of data you collect if there is no value to the information collected then is not point of view of collecting that kind of data so value to the to the collected information given then only the data has come recognition. So we can say value plays an important role in the analysed data.
6. VARIABILITY:- Variability is nothing but how the data keeps changing in tis structure, meaning and the shape. This could also be important how suddem changes are applied in the sources of the data.

PHASES OF BIG DATA ANALYSIS:-
1.	DATA ACQUISITION OR RECORDING:-  
             This is the first phase of the big data analysis where the information is collected from the required sources like which is in the form of the raw data. Basically, this kind of  raw data is in the form of unstructured data, structured data and semi-structured data.  As it is being collected directly from the sources without any organising it may be in the form of unstructured data itself and this unstructured data has to under go changes like data mining and data cleaning as well.  And it is also essential to note down how the data is being collected and this data has to be stored for further analysis as well.
2.	INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND CLEANING:-
             This is the second phases in the big data analysis after the collection of the unstructured data from the different sources, this unstructured data has to go certain changes to enhance cleaned data in an organised manner. In the collected data there may be information which is useful or not useful and at this scenario the what is relevant we can just save that kind of data and transform the unstructured data by cleaning what is required like removing the outliers,and inconsistencies in the data and also deal with the important information which can be potrayed.
3.DATA INTEGRATION, AGGREGATION, AND REPRESENTATION:-
         So the third form of the big data analysis is the data integration which means where the data has to be combined from the different sources and information should be accurate such that which helps in reducing the redundancies and inconsistencies from the collected data. Howeve, after making the organised data this should also be present full and attention seeking so that we can apply charts like graphs, diagrams and other kind of data which focuses towards the presenting the data effeciently.
4.QUERY PROCESSING,DATA MODELING AND ANALYSIS:-
       Here comes the fourth phase of the big data is the query processing is a helpful to receive the useful insights from the structured data and then this data follows the data model which is created by the structured data which is organised which applies a variety of intacts and this analysis can further done in the form of statistical interpretation or machine learning etc.
4.	INTERPRETATION:- Finally comes the last phase of the big data is the interpretation which is nothing but the whatever we have done completing all the phases we should now have to interpret the  analysis  like more good features which are very eye sparking to the customers or the computers as well. And hence we have to more visualisations so that is made efficiently and ready to be used by the businesses.

CHALLENGES OF BIG DATA:-

1.	HETEROGENITY AND INCOMPLETENESS:-  The first most challenge which is face is the heterogeneity which means that the data is not structured and not similar and we have to make sure that his data is homogenous so that we can analyse the data efficiently and human can make this heterogenous data to homogenous data by analysing the collected data. Hence we have to make sure that the data is complete so that we can do further process without any confusion.
2.	SCALABILITY:- Due to the increase and changes occurring all the time in the data, the size of the data is also increasing rapidly and hence the volume of the data is increasing rapidly day by day. This is the biggest challenge to overcome because the size of the data is not at a constant position and is increasing.
3.	TIMELINESS:- The third challenge of the big data is the timeline where the timeline is nothing but the where it is difficult to develop data at the right time without any particular insights. To acquire data at the right time without following a particular insights to deliver the data accurately. Data which is extensively high is really difficult to deal with and to get the possible outcome at the right time is also difficult.
4.	PRIVACY:- The fourth most difficult challenge is to maintain the privacy of the collected data which is being transformed and ready to deliver. The big data which is transformed has to be protected because the important information of the individuals is stored and this data which is increasing rapidly its really risky to keep this data private.
5.	HUMAN COLLABORATION: The last phase of the big data challenges are the human collaboration which means that though there is usage of lots of machine resources which helps in sorting the data which uses the algorithm in the same way the human can also learn and implement the same algorithm.
